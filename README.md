### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
1. For Data cleaning
2. For Data Analysis
3. For Data Visualization
   
- SQL- Structured Query Language for quering data
- Power BI for Data Analysis and Visualization
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as:
- The subscription patterns
- The Average Subscription duration
- The most popular subscription type

 ### Data Cleaning and Preparation
  ---
  In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, the following actions were performed.
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing varriables
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Data Analysis
---
This is where some basic lines of codes or queries or even some DAX expressions were included in the Analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER DATA
WHERE SUBSCRIPTION TYPE = BASIC
```

### Inferences
---
- Region/Subscription Type
  1. The East an the North Region both subscribed for the Basic subscription type while the South region goes for the premium and the West was the standard subscription type. The Average  subscription duration was 365.
  2. The most popular subscription duration was Basic with the highest subscription count of 16,921 as against both the premium and standard with 8,446 and 8,420 counts respectively.

- Region/Revenue
   
  There was no significant difference in the revenue from all the regions but there was a great difference the Revenue from the subscription types with the Basic having 50% of the Revenue while the Premium and the Standard are both 255 each.

  ### Conclusions
  ---
- Basic was the most popular subscription type, therefore it should be made readily available for the subscribers in order to maintain and increase the Revenue flows in the Regions
- Efforts should be put in place to increase the Revenue and the subscription counts across the Regions.
